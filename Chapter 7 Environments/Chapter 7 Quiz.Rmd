1. **List at least three ways that an environment differs from a list.**

* An environment must have unique bindings, which is why it modifies-in-place.

* An environment has a parent.

* An environment cannot be subsetted using numeric indices or single `[` operator for multiple elements.

* The elements of an environment is not ordered. 

* Every object in an environment must have a name.

2. **What is the parent of the global environment? What is the only environment that doesnâ€™t have a parent?**

The parent of the global environment is the last package attached to the search path. The only environment without a parent is the empty environment to which all environments terminate.

3. **What is the enclosing environment of a function? Why is it important?**

The enclosing environment of a function is the environment where it was defined. It controls where the function looks for its variables.

4. **How do you determine the environment from which a function was called?**

Use `rlang::caller_env()`.

5. **How are <- and <<- different?**

The assignment operator creates a binding from a name to an object in the current environment while the super assignment operator rebinds an *existing* name in a parent of the current environment.
