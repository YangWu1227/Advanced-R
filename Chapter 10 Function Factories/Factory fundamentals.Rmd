&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The underlying key idea behind function factories can be succinctly expressed as follows:

> The enclosing environment of the manufactured function is an execution environment of the function factory --- Hadley Wickham

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can understand this better using an example. Suppose we have a function factory called `power`, which returns children functions that raise their input arguments to different powers, contingent on the `exp` argument supplied to the factory function:  

```{r}
power <- function(exp) {

  # This is the last evaluated expression and so the function returns another function
  # It takes an input "x" and raises it to the power of "exp"
  # The argument "exp" is supplied as an argument to "power"
  function(x) {
    x^exp
  }
}
```

By varying on our inputs to `exp` via `power`, we can create a class of functions that behave differently:

```{r}
square <- power(exp = 2)
cube <- power(exp = 3)
```

Let us see it in action:

```{r}
square(x = 32)
cube(x = 9)
```

As can be seen, these functions are exactly how we would expect them to behave. But why do they behave differently? From the looks of it, their function bodies are exactly the same:

```{r}
square
cube
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It turns out that the most important difference between these functions is that they have different enclosing or function environments (see the different environment addresses in the output above). The enclosing environments control how these functions scope for values of `exp`. Each time a function is executed in R, a new **execution** environment is created to host its execution. The first time we executed `power` to create `square`, an environment is created. Then, another execution environment of `power` is created when we generated `cube`. These two execution environments are the **enclosing environments** of `square` and `cube`. The `rlang` package contains functions that provide more insights into these relationships:

```{r}
# Examine the environments associated with the function square
rlang::env_print(env = square)
# Examine the environments associated with the function cube
rlang::env_print(env = cube)
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As can be seen, there are two different environment addresses associated with these two functions, each of which was an execution environment of `power`. These environments have the same parent--- the enclosing or function environment of `power`, which is also the global environment in which `power` was created. Both the environments for `square` and `cube` contain a binding to `exp`; we can access the value of `exp` to see ultimately why these two functions behave differently:

```{r}
# Examine the value of "exp" in the enclosing environment of square
rlang::fn_env(fn = square)[["exp"]]
# Examine the value of "exp" in the enclosing environment of cube
rlang::fn_env(fn = cube)[["exp"]]
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in short, `square` and `cube` behave differently since the names `exp` in their enclosing environments are bound to different values.

## Diagrams

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These relationships between a function factory and its children functions can be analyzed diagrammatically. The components of the diagram below are:

* The boat-like structures are the functions, i.e. `power`, `square`, and `cube`.

* The global environment is represented by the rectangular shape labeled "R_GlobalEnv."

* The execution environments of `power` or, equivalently, the enclosing environments of `square` and `cube` are symbolized by the grey boxes each of which has a binding to `exp`. 

* The black arrows indicate **bindings** either from names to objects--- be it a function object like `power` or a vector object like 2--- or from a function object to its enclosing environment--- whether it is when `power` binds its enclosing global environment or when `square` and `cube` bind to their respective enclosing environments.

* The blue arrows indicate relationships between environments and their parent environments. The blue arrow always goes in a one-way direction from the child environment to the parent environment.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Diagram from [Advance R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/function-factories.html)"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "Diagrams/function_fact1.png")
```

From the diagram, the relationships can be summarized as follows:

* The function `power` (bottom-right) binds the global environment, which is where it was created. The global environment has a binding from the name "power1" to the function object (boat-like structure). These two bindings are made clear in the diagram by the black arrows *pointing* from `power` to global and from global to `power`.

* The global environment has in its bag two other bindings from the names "square" and "cube" to the function objects located in the top left of the diagram.

* The parent of the execution environments of `power` is the function or enclosing environment of `power`. The blue arrows going from the grey boxes to the bloat-like structure representing `power` reveal these relationships. 

  - The two execution environments are bound by the function objects `square` and `cube`, which is why there are black arrows pointing from their structures to the grey boxes in the diagram above. 
  
  - The two execution environments each has its own binding to `exp` as indicated by the black arrows pointing from the grey boxes to the values 2 and 3.

# Execution environment of a child function

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens when we execute `square` and `cube`? The answer is--- same as before. Each time a function is called, an environment is created to host its execution. The parent of this execution environment is the enclosing or function environment of the function, which is determined by where it is created. Therefore, calling `square` and `cube` individually generates execution environments of their own. And the parents of these execution environments are the enclosing or function environments of `square` and `cube`, respectively. For instance, let us look at `square`. We can explicitly return the execution environment of `square` by using the `current_env()` function from the `rlang` package:

```{r}
# New power function factory
power1 <- function(exp) {

  # Force the evaluation of "exp"
  base::force(exp)

  function(x) {
    x^exp
    # We explicitly force the return of the execution environment of any child function
    rlang::current_env()
  }
}
# New square function
square <- power1(exp = 2)
```

Now, whenever we execute `square`, it will return the execution environment of `square`:

```{r}
# Raise 10 to the power of 2
square(x = 10) %>%
  # Execution and its parent environment
  rlang::env_print()
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the output above, the **first line** represents the address of the execution environment of `square`. The **last line** shows that there is a binding from the name "x" to a double vector object ("dbl" is short for double), which is the argument that we supplied to the function `square`, $x=10$. The **second line** of the output above is of the utmost importance and it should make sense--- it is the enclosing environment of `square`. How can we be sure? Well, we can manually check the enclosing environment of `square`:   

```{r}
rlang::env_print(env = square)
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As can be seen, the first line of the output above indeed matches with the second line of the output from earlier. We now have a proof of the relationship between the execution environment and the enclosing environment of a child function. And, it is no different than the those of any other functions.

---

## Diagram

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But can we expound on the execution environment of a child function more? Perhaps we can see the relationships more clearly via a diagram:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Diagram from [Advance R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/function-factories.html)"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "Diagrams/square.png")
```

The relationships in the diagram can be summarized as follows: 

* The boat-like structure represents `square` (clearly, the name `square` is bound to this function object via the black arrow). The function also binds its enclosing environment, which is the grey box containing a binding to `exp`. Recall, that this is also the one of the execution environments of `power`. However, in this diagram, we are zooming in to get a more focused view on the child function `square`.  

* What we have proved in the section above is precisely the relationship between the grey box on top of `square` and the grey box to the right of `square`. The grey box on top is indeed the execution environment of `square` (with the blue arrow pointing to the function object), and the grey box to the right is its enclosing environment. When `square` is executed, it scopes for the value of "x" in the execution environment, $x=10$, and the value of `exp` in its enclosing environment, which is 2.

# Forcing evaluation

There is a bug in `power`. To see this, we can introduce some indirection:

```{r}
# Create binding from "x" to 2
x <- 2
# Now create a manufactured function
square <- power(exp = x)
# Examine the enclosing environment of square
rlang::env_print(env = square)
```

As can be seen, the `exp` argument is $<lazy>$. In other words, when `power` is run, the binding in the global environment from "x" to 2 is not accessed as it is not needed, and so `exp` is evaluated lazily to "x." More precisely, when `power` is executed to create `square`, the body of `square` appears like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
function(x) {
  x^(exp <- x)
}
```

However, when `square` is executed, the argument `exp` is evaluated so that if we rebind "x" to another value in the global environment, then  `exp` will be evaluated to a different value:

```{r}
# Rebind x to a new value
x <- 4
# Now run square
square(x = 2)
```

In this case, the body of `square` will look like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
function(x = 2) {
  # The exponent exp is scoped from the global env where x is bound to 4
  2^(exp <- x <- 4)
}
```

To solve this problem, we need to make sure that every argument only used by the *manufactured function* is evaluated:

```{r}
power2 <- function(exp) {
  # Force evaluate exp
  base::force(exp)
  function(x) {
    x^exp
  }
}
```

Let us take a look at the results now:

```{r}
# Bind x to 3
x <- 3
# Create cube function
cube <- power2(exp = x)
# The argument "x" is not evaluated lazily
rlang::env_print(env = cube)[["exp"]]
```

Evidently, the argument for `exp` is evaluated explicitly.

# Stateful functions

Statement factories enable us to maintain state across function invocations, which is difficult to accomplish because of the fresh-start principle. Two things make stateful functions possible:

* The enclosing environment of the child function, which is also the execution of the function factory, is unique and constant.

* The super assignment operator, `<<-`, modifies bindings in the enclosing environment of the manufactured function. This is because `<<-` rebinds existing names found in a parent environment. When a manufactured function is run, an execution environment is created whose parent is the enclosing environment of this manufactured function. So, using `<<-` within the execution environment of a child function actually modifies existing names in the parent environment--- the enclosing environment of the child function. If these bindings do not exist, `<<-` will create a binding in the parent.

All of this can be made more concrete using an example. The function factory below creates functions that count the number of times it is called:

```{r}
new_counter <- function() {

  # Initialize variable
  i <- 0

  # Child function
  function() {
    # This modifies the i in the enclosing environment, which is the execution env of new_counter
    i <<- i + 1
    i
  }
}
```

Next, we create two functions: 

```{r}
counter_one <- new_counter()
counter_two <- new_counter()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Diagram from [Advance R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/function-factories.html)"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "Diagrams/stateful0.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Diagram from [Advance R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/function-factories.html)"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "Diagrams/stateful.png")
```

Each of the two functions will be stateful functions that maintain states across each invocation. In addition, since the execution environment of each invocation to `new_counter` is different, the enclosing environment of each of the two functions will be unique and constant. Therefore, the functions will have independent counts:

```{r}
# First function
counter_one()
counter_one()
counter_one()
# Second function
counter_two()
counter_two()
counter_two()
counter_two()
```

# Exercises

## Exercise 1

Create a function `pick()` that takes an index, i, as an argument and returns a function with an argument x that subsets x with i.

```{r}
pick <- function(i) {

  # Force evaluate "i"
  # This will be a variable in an execution environment of pick()
  # Also the enclosing environment of the manufactured function where it scopes for values of i
  base::force(i)

  # Manufactured function
  # The argument x will be in the execution environment of each manufactured function
  function(x) {

    # Condition
    if (i > length(x)) {
      rlang::abort(message = "Subset out of bounds")
    }

    # Subset
    x[[i]]
  }
}
```

Let us see it in action:

```{r}
# Create a function that selects the fourth element of an input
subset_4 <- pick(i = 4)
# Create a random tibble of parameters
params <- tibble::tribble(
  ~ n, ~ mean, ~ sd,
  10L, 5, 23,
  10L, 9, 2,
  10L, 90, 24,
  10L, 83, 5,
  10L, 29, 30
)
# Create a list of random vectors with varying parameters
list <- purrr::pmap(.l = params, .f = rnorm)
list
# Now select the fourth element of each of the 5 vectors
purrr::map(.x = list, .f = pick(i = 4))
purrr::map(.x = list, .f = ~ subset_4(x = .x))
# Base R equivalent
base::lapply(X = list, FUN = subset_4)
```

---

## Exercise 2

Create a function that creates functions that compute the $i^{th}$ central moment of a numeric vector. Assume there is a sequence of random variables, $\mathrm{x}_{1}, \mathrm{X}_{2}, \ldots, \mathrm{X}_{n}$. We define the $r^{th}$ sample central moments as

\begin{align*}
C_{n}^{r} &=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(X_{i}-\mu_{i, 1}^{\prime}\right)^{r}, r=1,2,3, \ldots \\
\Rightarrow C_{n}^{1} &=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(X_{i}-\mu_{i, 1}^{\prime}\right) \\
\Rightarrow C_{n}^{2} &=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(X_{i}-\mu_{i, 1}^{\prime}\right)^{2}
\end{align*}

These are only defined if $\mu_{i, 1}^{\prime}$, the population mean, is known. If there is a sequence of random variables, $X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots X_{n}$, we will call the $r^{th}$ population moment of the $i^{th}$ random variable $\mu_{i, r}^{\prime}$ and define it as
\begin{align*}
\mu_{i, r}^{\prime}=E\left(X_{i}^{r}\right)
\end{align*}

```{r}
moment <- function(i) {
  
  # Force execution
  # This will be a variable in an execution environment of moment()
  # Also the enclosing environment of the manufactured function where it scopes for values of i
  base::force(i)
  
  # Manufactured function
  # The argument x is scoped from the execution environment of each manufactured function 
  function(x) {
    
    # Start from the innermost calculation by finding the deviations from the sample mean 
    (x - mean(x)) %>%
      # Raise each element of the resultant vector to the power of "i"
      `^`(., i) %>% 
      # Take the sum of the vector elements
      sum() %>% 
      # Divide by sample size
      `/`(., length(x))
  }
}
```

Let us see it in action:

```{r}
# Create a manufactured function that computes the 5th central moment given a sample
# Apply to random vectors in list
purrr::map(.x = list, .f = moment(i = 5))
# Check using function from the moments package
purrr::map(.x = list, .f = moments::moment, order = 5, central = TRUE)
```

---

## Exercise 3

What happens if you don’t use a closure? Make predictions, then verify with the code below.

```{r}
# Initialize i in global env, which is the enclosing env of new_counter2
i <- 0
# Create a function in global env
new_counter2 <- function() {
  i <<- i + 1
  i
}
```

We initialize "i" in the global environment, which is the enclosing environment of `new_counter2` and where it scopes for the value of "i". Each time `new_counter2` is executed, an execution environment is created where the function scopes for "i" in its enclosing environment and modifies it by adding one. Then, the function `new_counter2` returns the value for "i" when it completes. In other words, each time we call `new_counter2`, the "i" variable in the global environment will be modified. 

```{r}
new_counter2()
new_counter2()
new_counter2()
```

The downside to this is that, without the captured and encapsulated environment of a closure, the counts will be stored in the global environment. Here they can be overwritten or deleted as well as interfere with other counters.

---

## Exercise 4

What happens if you use <- instead of <<-? Make predictions, then verify with the code below.

```{r}
new_counter3 <- function() {
  i <- 0
  function() {
    i <- i + 1
    i
  }
}
```

The function above would not be a "stateful" function as the "fresh-start" principle will now apply. When the function `new_counter3` is run to create a manufactured function, an execution environment is created to host its execution . The "i" enclosed in this environment, which is also the enclosing environment where the manufactured function scopes for "i", will be the same $i=0$ each time the manufactured function is called. So the results returned by the manufactured function would be same each time:

* The function `new_counter3` is called and the binding $i=0$ is enclosed in its execution environment.

* The manufactured function is created and each time it is executed the function looks for the value of "i" in its own execution environment first. It does not find "i" there, so it looks up in its enclosing environment and finds it there. If "i" were defined in the execution environment of the *manufactured* function, then it would "mask" the "i" in the enclosing environment.

* Each time the manufactured function is called, $i$ is scoped as 0 and a binding is created where $i=0+1$ in the execution environment of this manufactured function. Each invocation of this function creates a new unique execution environment and hence the "fresh-start."

```{r}
# Create manufactured function
counter <- new_counter3()
# Run it to see if results will be the same, i.e. returns i = 1 every time
counter()
counter()
counter()
```

```{r}
rlang::env_unbind(env = rlang::caller_env(), nms = base::names(x = rlang::global_env()))
