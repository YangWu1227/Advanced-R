# Introduction

So far, we’ve used the word "object" in the general sense captured by John Chambers’ pithy quote: 

> “Everything that exists in R is an object."

However, while everything is an **object**, not everything is **object-oriented**. This confusion arises because the base objects come from S, and were developed before anyone thought that S might need an OOP system. We’ll use the terms **base objects** and **OO objects** to distinguish them:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Diagram from [Advance R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/function-factories.html)"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "oo_venn.png")
```

# Base versus OO objects

To differentiate between base and OO objects:

* The function `is.object(x)` returns TRUE if the object x has the R internal OBJECT bit set, and FALSE otherwise. The OBJECT bit is set when a "class" attribute is added and removed when that attribute is removed, so this is a very efficient way to check if an object has a class attribute

* The function `otype(x)` tells you if you're dealing with a base, S3, S4, RC, or R6 object

```{r}
# Base object
is.object(x = 1:23)
otype(x = 1:23)
# OO object
is.object(x = mtcars)
otype(x = mtcars)
```

The technical difference between base and OO objects is that OO objects have a "class" attribute:

```{r}
# Base objects do not have class attributes
attr(x = 1:10, which = "class", exact = FALSE)
# OO objects do have class attributes
attr(x = mtcars, which = "class", exact = FALSE)
```

The `class(x)` function is safe when applied to S3 and S4 objects but not base objects. It is safer to use `s3_class(x)`; compared to ``class(x)`, this function always returns the class vector that is used for method dispatch. This is most important for objects where the class attribute has not been set:

```{r}
# Create a base object
x <- matrix(data = 1:10, nrow = 5)
x
# Check object
otype(x = x)
# Class
class(x = x)
s3_class(x = x)
```

## Base types

While only OO objects have a class attributes, every object has a base type:

```{r}
# A base object has a base type integer
typeof(x = 1:23)
# A OO object has a base type list
typeof(x = mtcars)
```

At the C-level, all R objects are stored in a common datatype, the SEXP, or S-expression. All R objects are S-expressions so every C function that you create must return a SEXP as output and take SEXPs as inputs. (Technically, this is a pointer to a structure with typedef SEXPREC.) A SEXP is a variant type, with subtypes for all R’s data structures.  There are different base types, each with its C type names:

**Vectors**

* NULL (NULLSXP)
* double (REALSXP) 
* integer (INTSXP)
* logical (LGLSXP)
* character (STRSXP)
* complex (CPLSXP)
* raw (RAWSXP)
* list (VECSXP)

In C, lists are called VECSXPs not LISTSXPs. This is because early implementations of lists were Lisp-like linked lists, which are now known as “pairlists." Character vectors are a little more complicated than the other atomic vectors. A `STRSXP` contains a vector of `CHARSXP`, where each `CHARSXP` points to C-style string stored in a global pool. This design allows individual `CHARSXP` to be shared between multiple character vectors, reducing memory usage. 

**Functions**

* closure (CLOSXP)
* special (internal functions) (SPECIALSXP)
* builtin (primitive functions) (BBUILTINSXP)

**Environments**

* environment (ENVSXP)

**S4 type**

* S4 type (S4SXP)

**Language components**

* symbol (SYMSXP)
* language (LANGSXP)
* pairlist (LISTSXP)
* expression (EXPRSXP)

**Esoteric types**

* externalptr (EXTPTRSXP)
* weakref (WEAKREFSXP)
* byte-code (BCODESXP)
* promise (PROMSXP)
* ... (DOTSXP)
* any (ANYSXP)

## Numeric type

R uses "numeric" to mean slightly different things:

1. In some places numeric is used as an alias for the double type. For example `as.numeric()` is identical to `as.double()`, and `numeric()` is identical to `double()`. (R also occasionally uses real instead of double; NA_real_ is the one place that you’re likely to encounter this in practice.)

2. In the S3 and S4 systems, numeric is used as a shorthand for either `integer` or `double` type, and is used when picking methods:

```{r}
s3_class(1)
s3_class(1L)
```

3. The function `is.numeric()` tests for objects that **behave** like numbers. For example, factors have type “integer” but don’t behave like numbers (i.e. it doesn’t make sense to take the mean of factor):

```{r}
typeof(factor("x"))
is.numeric(factor("x"))
```
