## purrr::map()

A **functional** is a function that takes a function as an input and returns a vector as output. The most fundamental functional is `purrr::map(.x, .f, ...)`, which takes a vector and function, calls the function once for each element of the vector (that is, the function takes each element of the vector as an input), and returns the results in a list.

```{r}
# Function
triple <- function(x) x * 3
# Map
purrr::map(.x = 1:3, .f = triple)
```

### Graphically

```{r, out.height="30%", out.width="30%"}
# Import image
knitr::include_graphics("Diagrams/map.png")
```

This is related to a linear algebra concept: mapping from one vector space to another. the meaning of map refers to **an operation that associates each element of a given set with one or more elements of a second set. (One-to-one OR Isomorphism And One-to-many)**

---

### Implementation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
simple_map <- function(x, f, ...) {
  # Allocate a list the same length as the input
  out <- vector("list", length(x))
  # Fill in the list with a for loop
  for (i in seq_along(x)) {
    out[[i]] <- f(x[[i]], ...)
  }
  out
}
```

The real purrr::map() function has a few differences: it is written in C to eke out every last iota of performance, preserves names, and supports a few shortcuts.

```{r}
# Body of purrr::map
body(purrr::map)
# Written in C
rlang::is_primitive(.Call)
```

### Base equivalent

The base equivalent of map is `lapply(X, FUN, ...)`, which returns a list of the same length as X, each element of which is the result of applying FUN to the corresponding element of X.

---

## Producing atomic vectors

purrr uses the convention that suffixes refer to the output. All map_*() functions can take any type of vector as input. Some variants of `map()` are as follows:

* `map_chr(.x, .f, ...)`. The input is a data frame, which is named list and each element of that list is named vector. The functional below finds the types of each named vector in the mtcars data set. 

```{r}
# map_chr() always returns a named character vector
purrr::map_chr(.x = mtcars, .f = typeof)
# Structure
str(purrr::map_chr(.x = mtcars, .f = typeof))
```

---

* `map_lgl(.x, .f, ...)` The functional below checks if each named vector in the mtcars data set, which is a list in and of itself, is a double vector.

```{r}
# map_lgl() always returns a named logical vector
purrr::map_lgl(.x = mtcars, .f = is.double)
# Structure
str(purrr::map_lgl(.x = mtcars, .f = is.double))
```

---

* `map_int(.x, .f, ...)` The functional below finds the number of unique values in each of the variables in the mtcars data set.

```{r}
# map_int() always returns a named integer vector
n_unique <- function(x) length(unique(x))
purrr::map_int(.x = mtcars, .f = n_unique)
# Structure
str(purrr::map_int(.x = mtcars, .f = n_unique))
```

---

* `map_dbl(.x, .f, ...)` The functional below, combined with sub-setting, finds the mean of the "mpg" and "hp" variables in the mtcars data set.

```{r}
# map_dbl() always returns a named double vector
# Sub-setting with `[` preserves the data frame structure
purrr::map_dbl(.x = mtcars[c("mpg", "hp")], .f = mean)
# Structure and Type
str(purrr::map_dbl(.x = mtcars[c("mpg", "hp")], .f = mean))
typeof(purrr::map_dbl(.x = mtcars[c("mpg", "hp")], .f = mean))
```

All the functions supplied to the ".f" arguments above take vectors as inputs, since each element of mtcars is a named vector.

```{r, out.height="30%", out.width="30%"}
# Import image
knitr::include_graphics("Diagrams/map_dataframe.png")
```

In other words, all map functions always return an output vector the same length as the input, which implies that each call to .f must return a single value.

```{r}
# Length of data frame is simple the number of named vectors/columns
length(mtcars)
# map_*() always returns an output vector of the same length
length(purrr::map_chr(.x = mtcars, .f = typeof))
length(purrr::map_lgl(.x = mtcars, .f = is.double))
length(purrr::map_int(.x = mtcars, .f = n_unique))
# Subset of mtcars as the input
length(mtcars[c("mpg", "hp")])
length(purrr::map_dbl(.x = mtcars[c("mpg", "hp")], .f = mean))
```

### Base equivalent

The base equivalent that return atomic vectors: `sapply(X, FUN, ..., simplify = TRUE, USE.NAMES = TRUE)` and `vapply(X, FUN, FUN.VALUE, ..., USE.NAMES = TRUE)`. 

* The simplify argument in `sapply()` takes in a logical or character string indicating whether the result should be simplified to a vector, matrix or higher dimensional array if possible. 

* The FUN.VALUE argument in `vapply()` is a (generalized) vector that functions a template that describes the output shape.

* The USE.NAMES argument takes as input a logical; if TRUE and if X is character, use X as names for the result unless it had names already.

---

## Anonymous functions and shortcuts

Inline anonymous functions can be used:

```{r}
# Anonymous function
purrr::map_dbl(
  .x = mtcars,
  .f = function(x) length(unique(x))
)
# Shortcut using ~ and .x
map_dbl(
  .x = mtcars,
  .f = ~ length(unique(.x))
)
```

All purrr functions translate formulas, created by the "twiddle" ~ into functions. The underlying function is `as_mapper(.f, ...)`, which converts an object into a mapper function. The default method forwards its arguments to `rlang::as_function(x, env = caller_env())`. If the argument .f is supplied a formula, e.g. ~ .x + 2, it is converted to a function. There are three ways to **refer** to the arguments:

* For a single argument function, use . or .x, which Hadley recommends using

* For a two argument function, use .x and .y

* For more arguments, use ..1, ..2, ..3, ..4, etc.

### e.g. Four arguments

```{r}
# Create a function
f1 <- rlang::as_function(x = ~ ..1 + ..2 + ..3 - ..4)
# This function has four arguments
3 + 4 + 54 - 345
f1(3, 4, 54, 345)
```

In a `map()` function, the arguments of `f1()` can be referred to arbitrarily as ..1, ..2, and so on.

### e.g. Two arguments

```{r}
# Create a function
f2 <- rlang::as_function(x = ~ .x * .y)
# This function has two arguments
34 * -245.2
f2(34, -245.2)
```

In a `map()` function, the arguments of `f2()` can be referred to arbitrarily as .x and .y

### e.g. Generate random data

```{r}
# Create a list with three elements
# Fill each element with a pair of uniformly distributed random variables
x <- purrr::map(.x = 1:3, .f = ~ runif(n = 2))
x
```

The map functions also have shortcuts for extracting elements from a vector, powered by purrr::pluck(). You can use a character vector to select elements by name, an integer vector to select by position, or a list to select by both name and position. These are very useful for working with deeply nested lists, which often arise when working with JSON.

```{r}
# Create a nested list
x <- list(
  list(-1, x = 1, y = c(2), z = "a"),
  list(-2, x = 4, y = c(5, 6), z = "b"),
  list(-3, x = 8, y = c(9, 10, 11))
)
# Structure
str(x)
# Select by name
map_dbl(x, "x")
# Or by position
map_dbl(x, 1)
# Or by both
# This should select list elements with the name "y" first
# Then, select the first element of each of those objects with the name "y"
map_dbl(x, list("y", 1))
# Supply a .default value for missing elements
map_chr(x, "z", .default = NA)
```

---

## Passing arguments with dot-dot-dot

There are two ways:

1. Additional arguments can be passed on via an anonymous function:

```{r}
# Create a list
x <- list(1:5, c(1:10, NA))
x
# Pass the na.rm argument using an anonymous function
map_dbl(.x = x, .f = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE))
```

2. Additional arguments can be passed on via ... in `map()`:

```{r}
map_dbl(.x = x, .f = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

---

### Graphically

Any arguments that come after .f in the call to `map()` are inserted after the data in individual calls to f(), which is supplied as input to .f:

```{r, out.height="30%", out.width="30%"}
# Import image
knitr::include_graphics("Diagrams/additional_args.png")
```

**Note**: Notice that the blue box is the same across each call of `f()`. Placing additional arguments as ... in `map()` means they will be evaluated once. In contrast, placing additional arguments in an anonymous function means that they will be evaluated every time `f()` is called.

```{r}
# A function
plus <- function(x, y) x + y
# Create a vector
x <- c(0, 0, 0, 0)
# Placing the additional argument for y as ...
# This ensures that runif(n = 1) is only evaluated once
# The argument "y" is the same across each call of plus()
# The sum will be the same as a result
map_dbl(.x = x, .f = plus, runif(n = 1))
# Placing the additional argument for y in the anonymous which is evaluted each time plus() is called
# The argument "y" is different for each call of plus()
# The sum will be the different as a result
map_dbl(
  .x = x,
  .f = ~ plus(x = .x, y = runif(1))
)
```

---

**Note**: The arguments after .f are not decomposed; in other words, `map()` only is vectorized over its first argument. If an argument after f is a vector, it will be passed along as is:

```{r, out.height="30%", out.width="30%"}
# Import image
knitr::include_graphics("Diagrams/additional_args_vector.png")
```

---

## Varying another argument

The first argument to `map()` has always become the first argument to the function supplied to ".f". There may be cases where the first argument should be constant, and we want to vary a different argument:

```{r, out.height="30%", out.width="30%"}
# Import image
knitr::include_graphics("Diagrams/vary_another_arg.png")
```

Here the first argument is constant across each call of `f()`, the function call takes the elements of the vector as inputs of the second argument of `f()`. There are two ways to accomplish this indirectly:

1. Use an anonymous function to rearrange the argument order:

```{r}
# Define a vector
x <- sample(x = 1:23, size = 12, replace = TRUE)
# Define a vector of possible values for the trim argument in mean()
trims <- c(0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5)
# We need the first argument of mean() to be constant across each call of mean()
# We wish to vary the values of the trim = argument in mean across each call of mean()
# Now, the second argument is referred to as ".x" instead of the first
purrr::map_dbl(.x = trims, .f = ~ mean(x = x, trim = .x))
# Equivalently, without the helper ~
# Notice that function(trim) still takes the trims vector as its first argument "trim"
# However, the value of "trim" is used as the second argument of mean()
# This is a function nested in another function
purrr::map_dbl(
  .x = trims,
  .f = function(trim) mean(x = x, trim = trim)
)
```

2. Rewrite `mean(x, trim)` to be `mean(trim, x)`, so map can be used as `purrr::map_dbl(.x = trims, .f = mean, x = x)`. This works since R's argument matching rules dictate that exact argument names take precedence over position. So, each call actually looks like `mean(trim[[i]], x = x)`, where, although the elements of the input vector become the first arguments of `mean()` by position, they are taken as the second argument by `mean()` since the first argument "x = " is supplied via ..., taking precedence over the position of "trim[[i]]." 

```{r}
purrr::map_dbl(.x = trims, .f = mean, x = x)
```

## Exercise 

### Exercise 1

Use `as_mapper()` to explore how purrr generates anonymous functions for the integer, character, and list helpers. What helper allows you to extract attributes? Read the documentation to find out.

`map()` offers multiple ways (functions, formulas, and extractor functions) to specify its function argument (.f). Initially, the various inputs have to be transformed into a valid function, which is then applied. The creation of this valid function is the job of `as_mapper()` and it is called every time `map()` is used.

Given character, numeric or list input, `as_mapper()` will create an extractor function. A character selects by name, a numeric selects by positions, and a list allows for a mixture of these two approaches. This extractor interface can be very useful, when working with nested data.

The extractor function is implemented as a call to `purrr::pluck()`, which accepts a list of accessors (accessors “access” some part of your data object).

```{r}
as_mapper(.f = c(1, 2)) # equivalent to function(x) x[[1]][[2]]
as_mapper(.f = c("a", "b")) # equivalent to function(x) x[["a"]][["b]]
as_mapper(.f = list(1, "b")) # equivalent to function(x) x[[1]][["b]]
```
Besides mixing positions and names, it is also possible to pass along an accessor function. **This is basically an anonymous function that gets information about some aspect of the input data.** You are free to define your own accessor functions.

If you need to access certain attributes, the helper `attr_getter(attr)` is already predefined and will create the appropriate accessor function for you.

```{r}
# Define custom accessor function
get_class <- function(x) attr(x = x, which = "class")
pluck(.x = mtcars, get_class)
# Use attr_getter() as a helper
pluck(.x = mtcars, attr_getter(attr = "class"))
```

---

### Exercise 2

`map(1:3, ~ runif(2))` is a useful pattern for generating random numbers, but `map(1:3, runif(2))` is not. Why not? Can you explain why it returns the result that it does?

```{r}
# Generate a list where each element is a random double vector
list1 <- purrr::map(.x = 1:3, .f = ~ runif(n = 2))
list1
# Type
typeof(pluck(.x = list1, 1))
```

This first pattern creates multiple random numbers, because ~ runif(n = 2) successfully uses the formula interface. Internally `map()` applies the function `as_mapper()` to this formula, which converts ~ runif(n = 2) into an anonymous function. Afterwards `runif(n = 2)` is applied three times (one time during each iteration), leading to three different pairs of realized uniformly distributed random variables. The following code does not work:

```{r}
# This does not work
list2 <- purrr::map(.x = 1:3, .f = runif(n = 2))
list2
```

This is because the input `runif(n = 2)` is not a **valid function** to the argument ".f" of `map()`. `runif(n = 2)` is evaluated once before the results are passed to `map()`. Consequently `as_mapper()` creates an extractor function based on the returned values from `runif(n = 2)` (via `pluck()`). This leads to three NULLs (`pluck()`’s .default return), because no values corresponding to the index can be found.

```{r}
# Successful conversion of the function
as_mapper(.f = ~ runif(n = 2))
# This fails to work since pluck() is used
# Consider runif( n = 2)[[1]] as "k" and runif( n = 2)[[2]] as "w"
# The code below is equivalent to x[[k]][[w]]
# Obviously, those indices do not exist and so NULLs are returned
as_mapper(.f = runif(n = 2))
```

---

### Exercise 3

* Compute the standard deviation of every column in a numeric data frame:

```{r}
purrr::map_dbl(.x = mtcars, .f = sd)
```

* Compute the standard deviation of every numeric column in a mixed data frame (Hint: you’ll need to do it in two steps):

```{r}
# Load data
data("BirdNest")
# Determine indices of the numeric variables
index_numeric <- purrr::map_lgl(.x = BirdNest, .f = is.numeric)
# Subset and compute sd
purrr::map_dbl(.x = BirdNest[index_numeric], .f = sd)
```

* Compute the number of levels for every factor in a data frame:

```{r}
# Determine indices of the factors
index_factor <- purrr::map_lgl(.x = BirdNest, .f = is.factor)
# Subset and compute number of levels
# Anonymous function
purrr::map_int(
  .x = BirdNest[index_factor],
  .f = ~ length(levels(.x))
)
# This is equivalent to
purrr::map_int(
  .x = BirdNest[index_factor],
  .f = function(x) length(levels(x))
)
```

---

### Exercise 4

The following code simulates the performance of a t-test for **non-normal** data. Extract the p-value from each test, then visualize.

```{r}
# Simulates the power of t-test over 100 iterations
trials <- purrr::map(
  .x = 1:100,
  .f = ~ t.test(
    x = rpois(n = 10, lambda = 10),
    y = rpois(n = 10, lambda = 7)
  )
)
# Each element of the list "trials" is a sub-list of the results of the t.test() function
# The p.val can be extracted as follows
trials[[1]][["p.value"]]
# Using the shortcut for extracting elements by name powered by pluck()
# This is equivalent to trials[[i]][["p.value"]]
p_vals <- purrr::map_dbl(.x = trials, .f = "p.value")
# Compute power
power <- sum(p_vals < 0.05) / 100
power
```

The power of the two sample t test is 0.6, which is not great. We expect this since we are dealing with non-normal data, where the power of the test is diminished.

```{r}
# Visualize
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = p_vals, fill = p_vals < 0.05)) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = .01) + # geom_histogram() as alternative
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "top"
  )
```

---

### Exercise 5

The following code uses a map nested inside another map to apply a function to every element of a nested list. Why does it fail, and what do you need to do to make it work?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- list(
  list(1, c(3, 9)),
  list(c(3, 6), 7, c(4, 7, 6))
)
triple <- function(x) x * 3
map(x, map, .f = triple)
```

This function call fails, because triple() is specified as the .f argument and consequently belongs to the outer map(). The unnamed argument map is treated as an additional argument of triple() passed on via ..., which causes the error. There are a number of ways we could resolve the problem. However, there is not much to choose between them for this simple example, although it is good to know your options for more complicated cases:

* Don't name the argument:

```{r}
# Nested list
x <- list(
  list(1, c(3, 9)),
  list(c(3, 6), 7, c(4, 7, 6))
)
# Function
triple <- function(x) x * 3
# Solution 1
purrr::map(.x = x, .f = map, triple)
```

This way each call of `map()` inside of the outer `map()` is essentially `map(.x = x[[i]], .f = triple)`, where `triple` is passed to the inner `map()` as the second argument, i.e. (.f), via an additional argument ...

* Use magrittr-style or purrr-style anonymous function:

```{r}
# Use magrittr-style anonymous function
map(.x = x, .f = . %>% map(.f = triple))
# Use purrr-style anonymous function
map(.x = x, .f = ~ map(.x = .x, .f = triple))
# Or
map(.x = x, .f = ~ map(.x = ., .f = triple))
# These two approaches are all equivalent to
map(
  .x = x,
  .f = function(sub_list) map(.x = sub_list, .f = triple)
)
```

Here, the 1) "." in the magrittr-style anonymous function and the 2) ".x" in the purrr-style anonymous function are both used as placeholders for "sub_list". The magrittr-style anonymous function passes the placeholder for x[[i]] as the first argument of `map(.x = placeholder, .f = triple)` using the ` %>% ` operator. The purrr-style anonymous function uses the helper twiddle to convert the formula into a valid function.

---

### Exercise 6

Use `map()` to fit linear models to the mtcars data set using the formulas stored in this list:

```{r}
# List of formulas
formulas <- list(
  mpg ~ disp,
  mpg ~ I(1 / disp),
  mpg ~ disp + wt,
  mpg ~ I(1 / disp) + wt
)
# Type of each element
# A "language" is an R language construct
purrr::map(.x = formulas, .f = typeof)
# Fit linear models
linear_models <- purrr::map(.x = formulas, .f = lm, data = mtcars)
linear_models[[1]]
# Summary
linear_models_summary <- purrr::map(
  .x = formulas,
  .f = ~ summary(
    object = lm(
      formula = .x,
      data = mtcars
    )
  )
)
linear_models_summary[[2]]
```

---

### Exercise 7

Fit the simply linear regression model mpg ~ disp to each of the bootstrap replicates of mtcars in the list below, then extract the $R^{2}$ of the model fit:

```{r}
# Bootstrap function
bootstrap <- function(df) {
  # Sub-set as matrix
  # The data.frame structure is preserved
  df[sample(x = nrow(x = df), replace = TRUE), , drop = FALSE]
}
# 10 bootstrap replicates of mtcars
# Each element in "bootstraps" is a replicate data.frame of the original data.frame
bootstraps <- map(.x = 1:10, .f = ~ bootstrap(df = mtcars))
# Single [ returns a list, simplifying the data.frame to a list
is.data.frame(bootstraps[1])
# Double [[ returns a data.frame, preserving the structure
is.data.frame(bootstraps[[2]])
```

Here, the input vector needs to be the second argument of `lm(formula, data)`, and so we use an anonymous function:

```{r}
# List of models
models <- purrr::map(
  .x = bootstraps,
  .f = ~ summary(lm(formula = mpg ~ disp, data = .x))
)
models[[1]]
# Extract R squares
vector_of_rsquare <- purrr::map_dbl(
  .x = models,
  .f = "r.squared"
)
vector_of_rsquare
```

---

All the above can be chained together elegantly using the pipe operator:

```{r}
bootstraps %>%
  map(.f = ~ lm(mpg ~ disp, data = .x)) %>%
  map(.f = summary) %>%
  map_dbl(.f = "r.squared")
```
